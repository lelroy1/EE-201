# Personal Webpage for Lucas Elroy
Hi, my name is Lucas Elroy. I am interested in data analysis, software engineering and signal processing. Iâ€™m majoring Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington in the class of 2024. My email is lelroycollege@gmail.com.
## Professional life
- My first notable professional development was working for the City of Boise as a landscaper in the summer of 2021. This taught me a lot about the type of work I want to do.
- In the summer of 2022 I worked as a DRAM Product Engineer Intern for Micron in Boise. In this internship I learned a lot. I learned how semiconductors work on a fundamental level. I also learned all about DRAM fabrication and how DRAM works on a lower level. I plan to work there in the summer of 2023 and am very excited about the opportunity to learn even more.
## Personal Life
- I love skiing! I have hurt myself many times doing this, but it has not diminished my love for it at all!
- I play bass guitar for a Seattle local band. I also play regular guitar, but not well enough to play it for my band.
- I like to explore Seattle in my spare time. I particularly enjoy going to new cafes. I try to go to at least 1 new one every week.
